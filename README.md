# ezgit

git should be easy to learn. It's nearly ubiquitous and you only need a few commands to get started.

For new users, though, git is full of hazards, with confusing error messages and many easy paths to states that even the somewhat experienced may have trouble recovering from.

My goal with ezgit is to provide a very thin wrapper around git's CLI that nudges learners in the right direction when they get stuck and provides simple explanations of the important commands. After you feel like you have a good grasp on the commands, you can seamlessly move on to using git proper. Conversely, if you already have some experience with git but want to learn how to use a certain command or fulfill a certain goal, you can easily run ezgit to learn, then return to your usual workflow.

The main utility of this tool comes in the form of the docs, which you can access as needed in the terminal. You can also peruse them at your own leisure on this GitHub page.
